    "The goal of this exercise is to analyse data taken by a radio receiver. You will study the statistical properties of thermal noise, and measure the noise temperature of some receiver. Since we are doing this remotely, I wrote a short code that generates mock data, but let's imagine together that it really does come from some commercially available receiver. Let's quickly look at one such receiver, the **AirSpy**, since this is the one we were using when this course was in person. A picture of the interior of the device is shown below."

Thanks to its heterodyne mixer, it is tunable to any frequency between 24 and 1800 MHz. Below is a schematic of the relevant components that are relevant to the exercise."

    "\n",
    "- n_samples (int): determines the total number of time samples. I recommend using n_samples = int(1e6), which is also the default value of the function. More than that will be too slow, less than that is not enough for good statistics. If it's still too slow, one order of magnitude below, i.e. n_samples = int(1e5), still produces usable statistics. \n",
    "- T (float): the temperature of the load, in kelvins. I recommend trying with T = 300.0 (room temperature) first, which is also the default value of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this mock receiver has other properties which you have no control over, that I have determined. I call these properties the \"metadata\", and I define each of them below. Here they are:\n",
    "- The sampling rate is 10 MHz ( $\\Delta t = $ 100 ns), such that the  bandwidth is 5 MHz.\n",
    "- The resolution is 12 bits, so the data range from 0 to 2¹² - 1 integers. **The bits are proportional to the measured voltage, so the power will be proportional to the bits squared.**\n",
